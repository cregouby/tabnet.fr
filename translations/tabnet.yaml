      (int) Width of the attention embedding for each mask. According to
      the paper n_d = n_a is usually a good choice. (default=8)

      (int) Number of steps in the architecture
      (usually between 3 and 10)
    translation: ~
  mask_type:
    original: |-
      (character) Final layer of feature selector in the attentive_transformer
      block, either \code{"sparsemax"} or \code{"entmax"}.Defaults to \code{"sparsemax"}.

    translation: ~
  penalty:
    original: |-
      This is the extra sparsity loss coefficient as proposed
      in the original paper. The bigger this coefficient is, the sparser your model
      will be in terms of feature selection. Depending on the difficulty of your
      problem, reducing this value could help (default 1e-3).
    translation: ~
  feature_reusage:
    original: |-
      (float) This is the coefficient for feature reusage in the masks.
      A value close to 1 will make mask selection least correlated between layers.
      Values range from 1.0 to 2.0.

    translation: ~
  optimizer:
    original: |-

      you can also pass any torch optimizer function.

      for regression and cross entropy for classification)

  clip_value:
    original: |-

      (logical) Whether to drop last batch if not complete during
      training
    translation: ~
  lr_scheduler:
    original: |-
      if \code{NULL}, no learning rate decay is used. If "step"
      decays the learning rate by \code{lr_decay} every \code{step_size} epochs. If "reduce_on_plateau"
      decays the learning rate by \code{lr_decay} when no improvement after \code{step_size} epochs.
      It can also be a \link[torch:lr_scheduler]{torch::lr_scheduler} function that only takes the optimizer
      as parameter. The \code{step} method is called once per epoch.
    translation: ~
  lr_decay:
    original: |-
      multiplies the initial learning rate by \code{lr_decay} every
      \code{step_size} epochs. Unused if \code{lr_scheduler} is a \code{torch::lr_scheduler}
      or \code{NULL}.

      \code{lr_scheduler} is a \code{torch::lr_scheduler} or \code{NULL}.

  checkpoint_epochs:

      \code{checkpoint_epochs}. (default is 10). This may cause large memory usage.

  tabnet_model:

      A previously fitted TabNet model object to continue the fitting on.

  from_epoch:
    original: |-
      When a \code{tabnet_model} is provided, restore the network weights from a specific epoch.
      Default is last available checkpoint for restored model, or last epoch for in-memory model.

section{Threading}:
  original: |
    TabNet uses \code{torch} as its backend for computation and \code{torch} uses all
    available threads by default.

    You can control the number of threads used by \code{torch} with:

    \if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{torch::torch_set_num_threads(1)
    torch::torch_set_num_interop_threads(1)
    }\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
